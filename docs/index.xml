      <description>Fez has always had an affinity with Father Christmas (some call him Santa this is obviously not correct). Why I hear you ask? Well one of them wears a red hat and one of them is a red hat. They are very close. Hence this blog post is coming incredibly easy for me (Karl) and not at all something I just I forced myself to write whilst jet-lagging.
You may by now assume that fez isn&amp;rsquo;t just a hat from the Moroccan city of the same name.</description>
